          <b>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> How do you get my consent? </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          When we receive your personal information from your end in order to
          complete a transaction, purchase or pay for the service, and we
          arrange for a delivery of the product or service, we ultimately imply

          reason only.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your personal information is asked for a secondary purpose, such as
          marketing, Quidditch will never ask you directly for your consent for
          providing you with an option to say no.

          In case, you have opted in to get updates but tend to change your mind
          in time, you may also withdraw your consent with us to contact you,

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Quidditch may disclose your personal information if we are required by
          the law to do so or if Quidditch’s Terms of Service are violated by
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Payment </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, we are receiving payment through direct bank transfer or
          online payment (No payment gateway on the website)
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note : We only take payments under the official bank account of
          our company 'Quidditch Finance', contact 8412959077 before you make
          any payments for confirmation purpose
        </p>
        <p>
          Incase in the near future we start a payment gateway on the website
        </p>
        <p>
          All payments made on our website will be secure and safe. If you
          choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then
          www.quidditchfinance.com stores your credit card data. It is encrypted
          through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
          Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary
          to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your
          purchase transaction information is deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
          managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort
          of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.
        </p>
        <p>
          PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
          information by our store and its service providers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect,
          use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow
          them to perform the services they provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
          gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own
          privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to
          provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
          so you can understand the manner in which your personal information
          will be handled by these providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or
          have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than
          either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
          involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your
          information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in
          which that service provider or its facilities are located.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is
          processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your
          personal information used in completing that transaction may be
          subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the
          Patriot Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website
          or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or
          our website’s Terms of Service.
