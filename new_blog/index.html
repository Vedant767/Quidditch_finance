        <h2>Algorithmic Trading</h2>
        <p>
          Algorithmic trading is slowly becoming the natural order of the
          capital markets. According to a circular found on the NSE website,
          about 60-70% of the total trading volume comes from algorithms or
          computers. First, let us understand the difference between Algorithmic
          and Quantitative Trading and later see how they differ from
          discretionary trading(manual trading).

        <h1>Why indicators don’t reveal everything?</h1>
        <h2>Trading Indicators</h2>
        <p>
          As much success that traders have had using the methods of technical
          analysis and indicators to drive their decisions, but the indicators
          are still viewed as just numbers, the assumptions that were used in
          the mathematics behind it and the real significance behind those
          numbers are all still in the dark and people use them without knowing
          their utility, nuances and most of the pitfalls.

        <h2>Uncertainty of Life</h2>
        <p>
          For the first time since this pandemic, I have encountered clients
          withdrawing investments for medical emergencies, before this, they

        <h2>Internal Structure</h2>
        <p>
          In this article, we will try and explain how all major financial
          markets in the world function and why it is important to understand
          how they function for you to exploit them and make money from them.
          Before we start I would like to clarify that this article is written
          for novices and the concepts explained are simplified for the reader
          to understand and so the logic is not airtight.
